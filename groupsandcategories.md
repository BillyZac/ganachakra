# The Relationship of Groups and Categories

We have practice level groups:

- Tantrika
- Sadhaka
- Six Yoga

Each member should be assigned to the practice group they belong to - So a sadhaka is only part of the sadhaka group.

When categories are created, you can say what groups can see that category. So, for the tantrika category, you would say that Six Yogas, 
Sadhakas, and Tantrikas can see this group, and for the Sadhaka group, Sadhakas and Six Yogas can see this. Only Six Yogas can see the Six Yogas
section.

We can also add additional groups, like:

- Meditaiton Instructor
- Family Mandala

People can be added to these groups in addition to their practice group.

Generally, we want to limit "group" membership - just a practice group, then any other groups that are appropriate.
Then categories will "filter" people based on these groups.
